## `movies` app

The original code and data for this shiny app comes from the [Building Web Applications with Shiny](https://rstudio-education.github.io/shiny-course/) course.

I've converted it have [shiny modules](https://shiny.posit.co/r/articles/improve/modules/) and a [standalone app function](https://mastering-shiny.org/scaling-packaging.html#converting-an-existing-app) (which can be run from `app.R`).
